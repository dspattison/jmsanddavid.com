			<h1>About Us</h1>
			<img style='float:right' src='Thumbnails/11.jpg'/>
			<h2>Jeanne-Marie</h2>
			<p>
				Is the most beautiful person in the whole world.
				She grew up in Marin. 
				While at UC Davis, she joined the ski team and met David.
				She became a Doctor at Touro
				and is now doing a Family Medicine Residency in Long Beach.
				She likes:
				<ul>
					<li>Cheeses
					<li>David
					<li>Snowflakes
					<li>The color Red
					<li>Switzerland
					<li>Skiing
					<li>Traveling
					<li>Cooking
					<li>Biking
				</ul>

			</p>
			<div style="clear:both"></div>
			
			<h2>David</h2>
			<p>
				If you know David, you know he loves pizza and skiing. 
				Skiing with Jeanne-Marie and eating pizza is his recipe for a perfect day. 
				A computer nerd at heart, he works for Zoosk.com which helps people find true love. 
				He also likes:
				<ul>
					<li>Brewing his own beer
					<li>Traveling the world to find the best ski spots
					<li>Mountain biking
					<li>Watching sci-fi shows while JM falls asleep
					<li>Skiing
					<li>and of course, pizza
				</ul>
			</p>

			
			<h2>How we met</h2>
			<p>
				In the fall of 05, Jeanne-Marie returned to Davis and the Ski Team after a year abroad in France, and there were a few new skiers on the team. One of them stood out, and not just for his crazy turns and mad skills on the hill.  
				They skied together all season, but when the snow melted, they stuck together. 
				7 years, several moves, and 4 years of medical school later, they are now living the SoCal life in Long Beach, CA where they'll be for the next few years, but still try to get to the mountains as much as they can.

			<h1>Engagement</h1>
			<p>The sky was blue and the birds where chirping.  
			I knew this was going to be a great day.
			I took Jeanne-Marie hiking.  
			The top of the mountain was far.  
			Jeanne-Marie wasn't getting tired, but I was  
			from a giant boulder in my pocket.
			We finally got to the top, I asked Jeanne-Marie to pose for a picture.
			This was a ruse; while she turned around I took the ring out of my pocket and trembling, I proposed.
			After a shower of tears, she finally had to the ability to say yes.
